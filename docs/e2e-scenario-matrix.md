# Tentacle E2E Scenario Matrix — Source of Truth

This is the authoritative ledger for **every** Tentacle E2E scenario across Windows + Linux. The goal: green test suite alone gives confidence to ship — no manual UI smoke testing needed.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ⚪ Planned | Identified, not yet implemented |
| 🟡 WIP | Under active development |
| 🟢 Covered | Implemented, passing on macOS skip-guard, awaiting Windows verification |
| ✅ Verified | Implemented + green on the target OS runner |

## Fidelity legend (per Rule 12)

| Tier | What it means |
|---|---|
| 🟢 H | High-fidelity: real prod class + real OS resource |
| 🟡 M | Medium: inline mirror with drift detector OR real prod + mocked external dep |
| 🔵 F | Fixture-only: tests test infra, not production |

## Section A — Installation Scripts

`install-tentacle.sh` (Linux) / `install-tentacle.ps1` (Windows). One-liner installer that downloads zip/tarball, extracts to install dir, registers as Windows service / systemd unit.

| ID | Scenario | Win | Lin | Phase | Status | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1.h | Default `latest` install completes; binary at install dir; service registered + RUNNING | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |

| A6.u1 | 32-bit Windows env detection → friendly "not supported" exit | ✓ | — | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| A7.h | `--no-service-install` → extracts binary, prints next-step hint, does NOT register service | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| A8.h | Re-run installer over existing install → succeeds (idempotent) | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |

| A10.h | apt repo configured: `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/squid.list` + key file | — | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| A10.u1 | apt repo unreachable → fallback to direct tarball, install still succeeds | — | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |

## Section E — Upgrade Flow

Server → tentacle wrapper → Phase A (download) → Phase B (binary swap + restart) → status report via `last-upgrade.json`. The most complex pipeline; round 1-3 of Phase 12.G fixed real production bugs in this area.

**Requires Phase 12.H StubSquidServer + local release-mirror HTTP fixture + apt/yum stub for Linux.**

Critical regression target — agent identity hinges on these files |

## Section G — Multi-Instance

Two or more instances on the same host without collision.

| ID | Scenario | Win | Lin | Phase | Status | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1.h | Install instance Foo + Bar on same host → both get unique service names + config dirs | ✓ | ✓ | 12.L | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| G1.h2 | Foo + Bar registered against different servers → independent identities | ✓ | ✓ | 12.L | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| G2.h | Uninstall Foo → Bar still works | ✓ | ✓ | 12.L | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| G3.u1 | Install Foo when Foo already exists → 1073 / "already exists" with clear error | ✓ | ✓ | 12.L | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| G4.u1 | Corrupt `instances.json` → graceful read, "Default" instance falls back | ✓ | ✓ | 12.L | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| G4.u2 | Missing `instances.json` → first register creates it | ✓ | ✓ | 12.L | ⚪ | 🟢 | |

**Section G total: 6 scenarios × 2 OS ≈ 8 tests** (some shared)

| H3.u1 | Non-admin / non-root user runs install with default install dir → friendly permission error with elevation hint | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| H4.u1 | Clock skew between server and tentacle (5 min) → cert validation still works (within tolerance) | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| H4.u2 | Clock skew >24h → cert validation fails with clear error | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| H5.u1 | DNS resolution failure for server URL → "could not resolve hostname" | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| H6.u1 | Transparent proxy in front of github.com → install succeeds via proxy | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| H6.u2 | Linux apt repo behind transparent proxy → `99-squid-direct.conf` bypass works | — | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| H7.u1 | Listening tentacle behind firewall blocking inbound 10933 → register fails with "could not connect" | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |
| H8.u1 | Server cert expired → handshake fails with "cert expired" message | ✓ | ✓ | 12.K | ⚪ | 🟢 | |

**Currently shipped on `main`: 89 verified scenarios (Windows + Linux + macOS skip-guard).** Linux upgrade flow has reached **happy-path parity** with Windows (E1.u1, E12.u1, E1.h2 all green on the GHA ubuntu-latest runner driving real production `upgrade-linux-tentacle.sh` against real systemd-run --scope + sudo + python3-healthz + LocalReleaseMirror). Highest-frequency operator workflows (install, register, deploy, upgrade dispatch + Linux upgrade lifecycle) at high-fidelity tier 🟢.

## Update protocol

- When a scenario moves status (Planned → WIP → Covered → Verified), update the row.
- When a new scenario is identified, add a row with `Planned` status.
- When a phase ships, update the rollout map's "Cumulative" column.
- PRs that touch Tentacle code SHOULD reference the matrix IDs they affect (e.g. "Implements C1.h, C1.u1, C1.u2").
